# fit_curve

JavaScript implementation of Philip J. Schneider's "Algorithm for Automatically Fitting Digitized Curves" from the book "Graphics Gems".
Converted from Python implementation.

Fit one or more cubic Bezier curves to a polyline. Works with 2D and 3D curves (and should work for higher dimensions too).

This is a Dart implementation of Philip J. Schneider's C code. The original C code is available on http://graphicsgems.org/ as well as in https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems

This implementation derived from the [Python](https://github.com/volkerp/fitCurves) by [Volker Poplawski](https://github.com/volkerp) and [JS](https://github.com/soswow/fit-curve/) bt [
Aleksandr Motsjonov](https://github.com/soswow/) implementations.
